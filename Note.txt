The Two Sum problem on LeetCode is a classic interview question in computer science. Some ways to solve it:
    1. Brute Force
    2. Using Hashtable
    3. 2 Pointers
    4. Binary Search

1. Brute Force: 
    - The simplest solution to this problem is to iterate over the array twice and check every pair of numbers to see if they add up to the target. 
    This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the array.
    - Time complexity: O(n^2)
    - Space complexity: O(1)
2. Hash Table: 
    - We can use a hash table to store the numbers we have seen so far, and their indices. As we iterate over the array, we check if the target 
    minus the current number is already in the hash table. If it is, we have found our solution. This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and 
    a space complexity of O(n).
    - Time complexity: O(n)
    - Space complexity: O(n)
3. Two-Pointers: 
    - We can also solve this problem using the two-pointers technique. First, we sort the array. Then, we initialize two pointers, one at the 
    beginning and one at the end of the array. We add the numbers at these pointers, and if the sum is greater than the target, we move the right 
    pointer to the left. If the sum is less than the target, we move the left pointer to the right. If the sum is equal to the target, we have 
    found our solution. This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, but it has a space complexity of O(1) since 
    we don't need to use any extra data structures.
    - Time complexity: O(n log n) - if the array is unsorted, we need to sort it first, which takes O(n log n) time. Otherwise, if the array is sorted,
    we can use two pointers to traverse the array, which takes O(n) time.
    - Space complexity: O(1)

4. Binary Search: 
    - If the array is sorted, we can use binary search to find the complement of each number (i.e., the target minus the current number) in the 
    array. This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, but it has a space complexity of O(1) since we don't need 
    to use any extra data structures.
    - Time complexity: O(n log n) - if the array is unsorted, we need to sort it first, which takes O(n log n) time. Otherwise, if the array is sorted,
    we can use binary search to find the target number, which takes O(log n) time. We need to perform binary search for each element in the array, 
    which takes O(n log n) time in total.
    - Space complexity: O(1) - if we use iterative binary search, or O(log n) - if we use recursive binary search.

The most efficient method is the hashtable method, which has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n). The 2 pointers and 
binary search methods can also be efficient if the array is sorted or if we can sort it first. The brute force method is the least efficient, 
with a time complexity of O(n^2).
